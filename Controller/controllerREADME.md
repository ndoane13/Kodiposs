# Controller Overview

## Philosophy
For this I wanted to experiment with languages that I haven't really written in before. In sticking with my usage of Tyler-based stuff, the vast majority of backend seems to either be written in C# or in Java, and since I spent 4 years in school writing Java, I've decided to try something different with this. I've used C# before with Unity, but Unity turns C# into a scripting language instead of a full, useful OO language. 
## Methodology
Most of the backend/controller stuff will be written in C# I think. Most of my actual experience writing code has been Java and I'd like to get a little something else under my belt in terms of language usage.
