## Philospohy
For this project, I wanted to mostly mess around with Tyler Tech's open source web component library, [Forge](https://github.com/tyler-technologies-oss/forge/). This is really just practice for me to potentially move into a dev spot within Tyler, and to try to understand their UX philosphy.
## Methodology
While Forge is a framework-agnostic set of web components, by Tyler's own admission Angular is the most heavily used JS framework on-site, and also seems to have the most thorough [adapter](https://github.com/tyler-technologies-oss/forge-angular) set up for it by the company itself. With that in mind, I will be using all the classics (HTMl/CSS/JS/TS), as well as the Angular framework for all views associated with this project.
