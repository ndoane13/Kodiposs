# Models

## Philosophy
This is for models. Not much to say about this one. Gonna split things up by item type, requisitioner, random stuff. 
## Methodology
This whole thing really started because I was bored and reading a ridiculous book on database theory and wanted to create a working database from their example. The database is functional and in the early stages. Hosted by MSSQL server, using T-SQL and SSMS for management.
